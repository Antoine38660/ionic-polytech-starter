This project is a fork of [ionic-app-starter](https://github.com/sebastien-p/ionic-app-starter) (currently being rewritten from the ground up) dedicated to Polytech Grenoble students.

It intentionally exposes less features/complexity than the upstream version because it is only meant for learning Cordova/Ionic.

So if you are interested in building complex hybrid applications, you should use *ionic-app-starter* instead.
